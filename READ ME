These notebooks were submitted to the SMU MSDS program as part of the Data Mining class.
The notebooks cover exploratory data analysis and various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

The data used for this analysis is the Olympic data set. The data be found here:

Lab 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Mini Lab: Cross Validation, Logistic Regression Model (with coefficeint interpretation) and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier with 
linear Support Vector Machine Model
Lab 2: Comparing the performance of multiple supervised machine learning algortithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM with SGD) on 
two different target variables.
Lab 3: Clustering. A thorough dive into unsupervised machine learning using several clustering algorithms.
