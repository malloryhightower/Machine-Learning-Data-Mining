These notebooks were submitted to the SMU MSDS program as part of the Data Mining class.
The notebooks cover exploratory data analysis and various supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

The data used for this analysis is the Olympic data set. It is in this repository and can also be found here:

Lab 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
Mini Lab: 
Lab 2: Comparing the performance of multiple supervised machine learning algortithms (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM with SGD) on 
two different target variables.
Lab 3: Clustering. A thorough dive into unsupervised machine learning using several clustering algorithms. 

Additional contributers to these notebooks are Brandon de la Houssaye and Rick Farrow.
